\title{Estimate Residuals from Factor Model}
\usage{
residuals(factors, loadings_list, returns)
}
\arguments{
\item{loadings_list}{A list where each element is a matrix of loadings corresponding
to the factors for each time period.}

\item{returns}{A matrix of asset returns with rows representing time periods and
columns representing assets.}

\item{factors_list}{A list where each element is a matrix representing factor data
for a specific time period.}
}
\value{
A matrix of residuals where each row corresponds to a time period and each
column corresponds to an asset.
}
\description{
This function estimates the residuals of asset returns after removing the effect
of factor-driven returns.
}
\details{
For each time period \eqn{t}, the function models the asset returns as:
\deqn{R_t = F_t \Lambda_t + \epsilon_t}
where \eqn{R_t} is the vector of asset returns, \eqn{F_t} is the factor matrix,
\eqn{\Lambda_t} is the loadings matrix, and \eqn{\epsilon_t} represents the residuals.

The residuals are computed as the difference between actual returns and the modeled
returns.

\examples{
# Example factors and loadings
factors_list <- list(
  matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 5),
  matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 5)
)
loadings_list <- list(
  matrix(runif(25), ncol = 5),
  matrix(runif(25), ncol = 5)
)

# Simulate returns matrix
returns <- matrix(rnorm(200 * 5, mean = 0.01, sd = 0.02), ncol = 5)

# Estimate residuals
resid <- residuals(factors_list, loadings_list, returns)
head(resid)
