Description: Provides the estimation of time-dependent covariance matrix of returns with the intended use for portfolio optimization. The package also offers methods for determining the optimal number of factors to be used in the covariance estimation, a hypothesis test of time-varying covariance, and user-friendly functions for portfolio optimization and rolling window evaluation.
