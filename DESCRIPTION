Description: Provides the estimation of time-dependent covariance matrix of
   returns with the intended use for portfolio optimization. The package also offers
   methods for determining the optimal number of factors to be used in the covariance
   estimation, a hypothesis test of time-varying covariance, and user-friendly
   functions for portfolio optimization and rolling window evaluation.
