\title{Compute Factor Covariance Matrix}
\usage{
factor_covariance(factors_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{factors_list}{A list where each element is a matrix representing factor data
for a specific period or scenario.}
}
\value{
A covariance matrix computed from the aggregated factors.
}
\description{
This function calculates the covariance matrix of aggregated factors by combining
individual factor lists.
}
\details{
The function aggregates all factors by row-binding them and then computes the covariance
matrix of the resulting matrix using the \code{cov} function.
}
\examples{
# Example factors list
factors_list <- list(
  matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 5),
  matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 5)
)

# Compute factor covariance
factor_cov <- factor_covariance(factors_list)
print(factor_cov)
